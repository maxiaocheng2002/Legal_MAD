If a party calls a witness to testify on a material issue, they are bound by the witness's testimony, even if it is later contradicted by another witness. This is because the party has the opportunity to control the testimony of their own witness and to present evidence to support their case. In this case, Paul called Wes to testify that Dan's car did not run the red light, and Wes testified accordingly. Paul is now bound by Wes's testimony, and Vic's testimony that Dan's car did run the red light is inadmissible as an attempt to impeach Paul's own witness.

    "question": "Jim watched a liquor store furtively for some time, planning to hold it up. He bought a realistic-looking toy gun for the job. One night, just before the store's closing time, he drove to the store, opened the front door and entered. He reached in his pocket for the toy gun, but then became frightened and began to move back toward the front door. However, the shopkeeper had seen the butt of the gun. Fearing a hold up, the shopkeeper produced a gun from under the counter, pointed it at Jim, and yelled, \"Stop!\" Jim ran to the door and the toy gun fell from his pocket. The shopkeeper fired. The shot missed Jim, but struck and killed a passerby outside the store.

Although the contract does not contain an express anti-assignment clause, the assignment of the contract to Coot was still a breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. This is because Addle's assignment of the contract to Coot was a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in every contract, which requires that one party not act in a manner that would deprive the other party of the benefits of the contract. In this case, Addle's assignment of the contract to Coot deprived Boone of the benefit of Addle's performance under the contract, which was to paint Boone's barn in accordance with the contract specifications. Therefore, Boone has a cause of action against Addle for damages.",

This is based on the doctrine of privity of contract, which holds that a party to a contract cannot assign their rights and duties to another party without the consent of the other party to the contract. Since the contract between Addle and Boone contains no provision regarding assignment, Addle's assignment of the contract to Coot is considered an assignment for the benefit of the assignor (Addle), not the assignee (Coot). As a result, Boone's rights and remedies under the contract remain unchanged, and he can only pursue damages against the party who breached the contract, which is Coot. This is in line with the holding in the case of Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 317, which states that 'an assignee acquires by operation of law the rights of an assignor against the obligor only to the extent that the assignee has assumed the assignor's duties under the contract.'",
