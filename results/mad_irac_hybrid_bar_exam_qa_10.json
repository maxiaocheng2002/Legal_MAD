Privity of contract dictates that only parties to a contract can enforce its terms. Since Coot was not a party to the original contract between Addle and Boone, Coot's failure to meet contract specifications does not bind Boone. Furthermore, the lack of an assignment clause in the contract suggests that Addle and Boone did not intend for the contract to be assignable, thereby limiting Coot's rights under the contract.",

    "prompt": "Jackson and Brannick planned to break into a federal government office to steal food stamps. Jackson telephoned Crowley one night and asked whether Crowley wanted to buy some \"hot\" food stamps. Crowley, who understood that \"hot\" meant stolen, said: \"Sure, bring them right over.\" Jackson and Brannick then successfully executed their scheme. That same night they delivered the food stamps to Crowley, who bought them for $500. Crowley did not ask when or by whom the stamps were stolen. All three were arrested. Jackson and Brannick entered guilty pleas in federal court to a charge of larceny in connection with the theft. Crowley was brought to trial in the state court on a charge of conspiracy to steal food stamps.",

Conspiracy is a crime that requires an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime. Aiding and abetting can be a sufficient basis for conspiracy liability.",
            "application": "In this case, Crowley knowingly and willingly aided and abetted the conspiracy by purchasing the stolen food stamps. He understood that the stamps were stolen, and he did not ask any questions about the source of the stamps. This level of knowledge and participation is sufficient to establish aiding and abetting liability. Furthermore, the fact that Jackson and Brannick were charged with larceny in connection with the theft is not necessary for Crowley's conspiracy liability, as aiding and abetting can be a sufficient basis for conspiracy liability.",
