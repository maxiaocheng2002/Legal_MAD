It applies when the harmful activity was operating before the plaintiffs acquired the property impacted by the nuisance. If the owners were aware of the nuisance-creating activity at the time they purchased the property, the defendant may invoke the defense of ‘coming to the nuisance’. This defense effectively argues that the plaintiffs knew what they were getting themselves into and assumed the risk of harm. While in the past, ‘coming to the nuisance’ was considered an absolute defense, today it is a factor that the courts will consider in determining whether the plaintiffs may recover for nuisance.[4] An example of this manifested in Foster v.

This fact distinguishes Howell v. Hill from the case at bar. Even though the wife of John Brassel may have been willing that the homestead be sold on October 24, 1942, the time at which the contemporaneous assent of the husband and wife must exist is the time when the deed is finally executed by her joinder therein. In other words, the deed is void as to the owner of the homestead who has executed a deed to the same until the other spouse joins therein with the contemporaneous assent of both.  Consequently, there can be no joinder by the wife in the execution of a conveyance of the homestead by the husband unless she executes the conveyance during his lifetime, and with his consent.",

        "gold_passage": "A scheme by which an owner of a defined area of land divides it up into a number of separate lots for sale (or lease) and imposes on the purchasers (or lessors) restrictions as to the use and development of the land by means of uniform covenants restricting the use to which the grantees may put the lots, with the express intention that the area as a whole, and each and every lot, will benefit thereby. For example, a scheme that restricts the development of each lot to a single-family residence and requires that all buildings are to be erected and maintained in general conformity with a set of rules that are imposed on all purchasers. A scheme of development establishes a form of 'local law' by which the development and management of the land is controlled for the benefit of all the purchasers and their successors. The essential aim of the scheme is that each purchaser will have the benefit of the same restrictions as those to which he has been subjected (Besch v. Hyman, 221 App Div 455, 223 NYS 233 (1927); Snow v. Van Dam, 291 Mass 477, 197 N.E. 224 (1935); Re Dolphin's Conveyance [1970] Ch 654, 662, [1970] 2 All ER 664; Brunner v Greenslade [1971] Ch 993, 1003, [1970] 3 All ER 836; Texaco Antilles Ltd v Kernochan [1973] AC 609, [1973] 2 All ER 118 (PC)).\nIn order to be able to enforce the provisions of a scheme of development each purchaser of an area of land (or his successor), as well as the common vendor, must have a right to enforce the restrictions for his own benefit (technically by suing for breach of a negative or restrictive covenant), and by the same token, must accept the burdens imposed on his use of the land. Thus, \"reciprocity is the foundation of the idea of a scheme … [and a purchaser] must know both the extent of his burden and the extent of his benefit\", Reid v Bickerstaff [1909] 2 Ch 305, 319, [1908-10] All ER Rep 298 (CA) (Re Palmer v Reesor (1914) 6 OWN 622, 624 (Can)) (in the US called the 'doctrine of reciprocal negative easement'). The reciprocal benefits and burdens are referred to as 'equitable servitudes' (as they are rights originating from the English Court of Equity—Tulk v Moxhay (1848) 2 Ph 774, 41 Eng Rep 1143) (Trustees of Columbia College v. Lynch, 70 NY 440 (1877); Allen v. Detroit, 167 Mich 464, 133 N.W. 317, 319 (1911); Weigman v. Kusel, 270 Ill 520, 110 N.E. 884 (1915)).\nIn common law, as a rule, a scheme of development requires five conditions to be satisfied for there to be the 'mutuality of enforcement', that is an essential element of the scheme: (i) the area to which the scheme applies must be clearly defined (Reid v Bickerstaff, supra; Whitgift Homes Ltd v Stocks [2001] EWCA Civ 1732, [2001] 48 EG 130 (CA)); (ii) any of the parties seeking to enforce the scheme must have derived title to the land from a common vendor (or from a successor in title who is bound in equity to the common vendor); (iii) that prior to selling the land the common vendor must have laid out the area for sale in lots with the intention that the restrictions, drawn up in accordance with a common plan, would be imposed on the use and development of all the plots; (iv) each purchaser must have accepted the restrictions on the understanding that similar restrictions would be imposed on each and every purchaser of any one of the lots; and (v) the restrictions must be intended by the vendor to be, and are, imposed for the benefit of each and every plot (although the restrictions imposed on each plot need not be identical: Elliston v Reacher [1909] 2 Ch 384; Allen v Veranne Builders Ltd [1988] NPC 11; Sanborn v. McLean, 233 Mich 227, 206 N.W. 496, 60 ALR 1212 (1925); Anno: 4 ALR2d 1364, 1369: General Plan of Subdivision—Notice; Cash v. Granite Springs Retreat Ass'n, Inc., 2011 WY 25, 248 P.3d 614 (WYO 2011)). However, a scheme of development is likely to bind any owner of land on the estate where: (i) it is clear that the common vendor's intention was to impose substantially the same restrictions on all the plots in the defined area; (ii) the purchasers acquired their plots on the understanding that the 'laws' of the estate would be binding on them and would benefit the entire estate; and (iii) it was intended that the purchasers would have reciprocal rights to enforce the law against the other owners (Re Wembley Park Estate Co Ltd's Transfer [1968] Ch 491, [1968] 1 All ER 457; Eagling v Gardner [1970] 2 All ER 838; The American Law Institute, Restatement of Property (St. Paul, MN: 1944), § 541; Wichmeyer v. Finch, 231 Ind 282, 107 N.E.2d 661, 665 (1952); Cf. Steinmann v. Silverman, 14 NY.2d 243, 251 NYS.2d 1, 200 N.E.2d 192 (1964) where there was no \"common scheme\" with respect to the covenants). \"The material thing I [Greene M.R.] think is that every purchaser … must know when he buys what are the regulations to which he is subjecting himself, and what are the regulations to which other purchasers on the estate will be called upon to subject themselves\", White v Bijou Mansions Ltd [1938] Ch 351, 361, [1938] 1 All ER 546 (CA).

One day when Adam was at the still alone, he was approached by Mitchell, who asked to buy a gallon of liquor. Mitchell was in fact a revenue officer. After Adam had sold him the liquor, Mitchell revealed his identity. Adam grabbed one of the rifles that the brothers kept handy in case of trouble with the law, and shot and wounded Mitchell. Other officers, hiding nearby, overpowered and arrested Adam. Shortly thereafter, Bailey came on the scene. The officers in hiding had been waiting for him. One of them approached him and asked to buy liquor. Bailey was suspicious and refused to sell. The officers nevertheless arrested him. Adam and Bailey were charged with conspiracy to violate revenue laws, illegal selling of liquor, and battery of the officer. On the charge of battery, which statement concerning Adam and Bailey is true?\n\n(A) Both are guilty.\n(B) Adam is guilty but Bailey is not, because Adam's act was outside the scope of the conspiracy.\n(C) Neither is guilty.\n(D) Adam is guilty but Bailey is not, because the conspiracy had terminated with the arrest of Adam.\n\nFinal Answer: ",

Whether this defense can be effectively asserted will depend largely on whether the person involved has made him or herself - in a temporary newsworthy capacity or a more permanent celebrity capacity - something of a public figure. In such cases, details of their private lives are more likely to be considered items of legitimate public interest. The passage of time may lessen the public interest in a given fact (the newsworthiness of it), which may weaken this defense.\nConsent\nConsent is a total defense. If the plaintiff has consented in some way to the disclosure, whether through a release form or through accepting an interview, then he or she cannot pursue a claim for public disclosure of private fact.\nPublic Record\nMatters of public record, such as birth date, military service records, and others, are exempted. The defendant may claim this defense by showing that the disclosed fact was actually a matter of public record.

Rule 901(b)(2) governs lay witness opinion testimony as it relates to handwriting identification. To be admissible, such testimony must be “based upon familiarity not acquired for purposes of the litigation.” Thus, nonexpert handwriting identification opinion testimony is admissible under Rule 901(b)(2) only if it satisfies Rule 701's requirements for lay witness opinion testimony. If either Rule's requirements are not met, the testimony is inadmissible.\nThe Eleventh Circuit held that establishing a proper foundation under Rules 701 and 901(b)(2) requires “detailed information” about the witness's relationship with the person whose handwriting is in question. It also requires the witness to identify “with particularity” the material relied on to establish familiarity with the person's handwriting.\nThe Eleventh Circuit agreed with the district court that the plaintiff's affidavit did not provide a foundation for her asserted familiarity with the insured's handwriting. Missing from the affidavit was detailed information regarding the correspondence or documents on which her claimed familiarity was based. Also absent was detailed information about her relationship with the insured. Without this, her testimony was inadmissible.",

One Saturday afternoon she went to Roger's Market, a local self-service grocery, and bought a can of corned beef. The can had printed on its label \"A Product of West Beef Company.\" The company was a reputable supplier of beef products. On Sunday evening, Susie prepared a sandwich for lunch for the next day, using the can of corned beef she had bought on Saturday. When Susie bit into her sandwich at lunch time the next day, a large sliver of bone concealed in the corned beef slice pierced between her teeth, broke one off, and came to rest deep in the roof of her mouth. This accident caused her to suffer severe pain and to incur medical expenses of $700. Susie brought two claims for damages: one against Roger's Market and the other against West Beef Company. The claims were tried together. At the trial, Susie proved all of the above facts leading up to her injury as well as the elements of her damage. West Beef Company, one of the defendants, proved that it had not processed and packed the corned beef, but that such had been done by its regular and independent supplier, Meat Packers, Inc. West Beef Company further proved that it had never obtained from Meat Packers, Inc. defective meat products, and that it had no way of knowing that the can contained any dangerous material. Roger's Market, the other defendant, proved that it had no way of knowing the content of the can was likely to cause harm, and that it had sold the products of West Beef Company for a number of yearshwithout ever having been told by a customer that the products were defective.

To questions put to them by the presiding judge after they had returned their verdict the jury answered that the plaintiff and motorman were in the exercise of due care, and that the defendant *261 was negligent. We think that the case was rightly submitted to the jury and we discover no error in regard to the instructions that were given or refused.\n1. As to the plaintiff's due care. The plaintiff was where he had a right to be and was engaged in the performance of his duty, and whether he should have seen and guarded against the danger of a collision and have exercised more supervision over the motorman, and whether, taking all of the circumstances into account, he was in the exercise of due care was plainly for the jury.\n2. As to the negligence of the motorman. We assume in the defendant's favor that if the motorman's negligence caused or contributed to the collision the plaintiff cannot recover. Yarnold v. Bowers, 186 Mass. 396, 71 N. E. 799; Allyn v. B. & M. R. R., 105 Mass. 77. The instructions on this point were, to say the least, sufficiently favorable to the defendant. We do not see how it could have been ruled as matter of law that the motorman was negligent.  The question of due care or negligence is ordinarily one for the jury. When the facts are undisputed it becomes one of law. In this case it was for the jury to determine what the facts were and then decide whether they showed that the motorman was or was not negligent. Whether he should have discovered the plight of the automobile before he did and whether he exercised proper care in the way in which he operated the car after he did discover it were clearly questions for the jury.\n3. As to the defendant's negligence. There was testimony which, if believed, tended to show that the accident was due to failure on the defendant's part to use the emergency brake, in other words to what might be found to be negligence in the manner in which he operated the car. It was for the jury to give such weight as they saw fit to his testimony and explanation in relation thereto.  It was also for them to say whether he exercised due care in turning into Leyford Terrace as he did and whether if he did not such want of due care on his part contributed to the accident. The question of defendant's negligence like that of the plaintiff's and motorman's due care was for the jury. It could not be ruled as matter of law that there was no evidence of negligence on his part.\n",

Macco stored discarded machinery, pending sale for scrap, on a large vacant area it owned. This area was unfenced and was one-quarter mile from the housing development where Philip lived. Macco knew that children frequently played in the area and on the machinery. Philip's parents had directed him not to play on the machinery because it was dangerous. One day Philip was playing on a press in Macco's storage area. The press had several wheels, each geared to the other. Philip climbed on the largest wheel, which was about five feet in diameter. Philip's weight caused the wheel to rotate, his foot was caught between two wheels that were set into motion, and he was severely injured. A claim for relief was asserted by Philip through a duly appointed guardian. Macco denied liability and pleaded Philip's contributory fault as a defense. In determining whether Macco breached a duty to Philip, which of the following is the most significant'?\n\n(A) Whether the press on which Philip was injured was visible from a public way\n(B) Whether the maintenance of the area for the storage of discarded machinery was a public nuisance\n(C) Whether Macco could have eliminated the risk of harm without unduly interfering with Macco's normal operations\n(D) Whether the maintenance of the area for the storage of discarded machinery was a private nuisance\n\nFinal Answer: ",

Donee beneficiaries are also allowed to include their promised property or estate into their own estate, as in the case of a 5 by 5 Power in Trust.\n\nAs with other situations involving third-party beneficiaries, donee beneficiaries have the legal right to demand benefits promised to them once their rights to the contract have vested.

        "gold_passage": "Any kind of contract may be considered broken (\"breached\") once one party unconditionally refuses to perform under the contract as promised, regardless of when performance is supposed to take place. This unconditional refusal is known as a \"repudiation\" of a contract.\nOnce one party to a contract indicates--either through words or actions--that it's not going to perform its contract obligations, the other party can immediately claim a breach of contract (failure to perform under the contract) and seek remedies such as payment. This is sometimes called an anticipatory breach of contract. Read on to learn more about the concepts of repudiation and anticipatory breach of contract. \nWhen Does Repudiation Occur?\nCourts usually recognize three types of repudiation when it comes to contract law:\nA positive and unconditional refusal is made to the other party (\"express repudiation\"). The other party must tell you, in essence, \"I'm not going through with the deal.\" It's not enough to make a qualified or ambiguous refusal. (For example, \"Unless this drought breaks, I won't be able to deliver the apples.\") The repudiation must be clear, straightforward, and directed at the other party. (For example, \"I will not be delivering the apples as promised.\")\nAn action makes it impossible for the other party to perform. When it comes to repudiation, actions speak as loudly as words. For example, let's say a couple was supposed to repay two loans from the profits of their business. Instead, the couple ran the business into the ground, incurring lots of other debts and making it impossible to pay back their original loans. Their reckless, voluntary actions counted as a repudiation of the original loan agreements.\nThe property that is the subject of the deal is transferred to someone else. If the contract is for the sale of property, repudiation occurs when one party transfers (or makes a deal to transfer) the property to a third party. For example, if you've contracted to buy a house and you learn that the other party has subsequently sold it to his brother, your sales contract has been repudiated (even if you never heard a word about it from the other party)",

Except in one particular, the conditions stated in this Section as necessary to make the actor liable are the same as those necessary to make a defendant liable under strict common law pleading in an action of trespass for battery. Under the rule stated in this Section, the actor's liability includes liability for offensive contacts which are intentionally caused, irrespective of whether they result directly or indirectly from the other's conduct, while the common law action of trespass for battery required the offensive contact to result directly from the actor's conduct.\nb. In order that one may be liable under the rule stated in this Section, he must have done an act as that word is defined in § 2. Therefore, if a third person takes hold of the defendant's hand and with it slaps another's face, the only act is that of the third person. The defendant's hand is used merely as an instrument by which the third person accomplishes his purpose and, therefore, the third person rather than the defendant is liable for the offensive contact caused by the use of the latter's hand.\nc. Meaning of “contact with another's person.” In order to make the actor liable under the rule stated in this Section, it is not necessary that he should bring any part of his own body in contact with another's person. It is enough that he intentionally cause his clothing or anything held or attached to him to come into such contact. So too, he is liable under the rule stated in this Section if he throws a substance, such as water, upon the other or if he sets a dog upon him. It is not necessary that the contact with the other's person be directly caused by some act of the actor. All that is necessary is that the actor intend to cause the other, directly or indirectly, to come in contact with a foreign substance in a manner which the other will reasonably regard as offensive. Thus, if the actor daubs with filth a towel which he expects another to use in wiping his face with the expectation that the other will smear his face with it and the other does so, the actor is liable as fully as though he had directly thrown the filth in the other's face or had otherwise smeared his face with it. So too, if the actor at a dignified social function, and for the purpose of making another appear ridiculous, pulls from under him a chair upon which he is about to sit, the actor is liable to the other under the rule stated in this Section.",

        "gold_passage": "An assignment is the transfer of rights held by one party called the “assignor” to another party called the “assignee.” The legal nature of the assignment and the contractual terms of the agreement between the parties determines some additional rights and liabilities that accompany the assignment. The assignment of rights under a contract usually completely transfers the rights to the assignee to receive the benefits accruing under the contract. Ordinarily, the term assignment is limited to the transfer of rights that are intangible, like contractual rights and rights connected with property. Merchants Service Co. v. Small Claims Court, 35 Cal. 2d 109, 113-114 (Cal. 1950). An assignment will generally be permitted under the law unless there is an express prohibition against assignment in the underlying contract or lease. Where assignments are permitted, the assignor need not consult the other party to the contract but may merely assign the rights at that time. However, an assignment cannot have any adverse effect on the duties of the other party to the contract, nor can it diminish the chance of the other party receiving complete performance. The assignor normally remains liable unless there is an agreement to the contrary by the other party to the contract. The effect of a valid assignment is to remove privity between the assignor and the obligor and create privity between the obligor and the assignee. Privity is usually defined as a direct and immediate contractual relationship. See Merchants case above. Further, for the assignment to be effective in most jurisdictions, it must occur in the present. One does not normally assign a future right; the assignment vests immediate rights and obligations. No specific language is required to create an assignment so long as the assignor makes clear his/her intent to assign identified contractual rights to the assignee. Since expensive litigation can erupt from ambiguous or vague language, obtaining the correct verbiage is vital. An agreement must manifest the intent to transfer rights and can either be oral or in writing and the rights assigned must be certain.",

            "user_prompt": "Construction Company contracted to build a laundry for Wash Company on the latter's vacant lot in a residential area. As a part of its work, Construction Company dug a trench from the partially completed laundry to the edge of a public sidewalk: waterlines were to be installed in the trench. Because of the contour of the land, the trench was dug to a depth ranging from 7 to 9 feet. Construction Company did not place any barriers around the trench and permitted it to lie open for almost a week while waiting for the delivery of water pipes. This was known to Wash Company, but it raised no objection. During the time the trench was open, a series of heavy rains fell, causing 5 feet of surface water to gather in the bottom of the trench. While this condition existed, 5-year-old Tommy, who was playing on the vacant lot with friends, stumbled and fell into the trench. Robert, an adult passerby, saw this and immediately lowered himself into the trench to rescue Tommy. However, his doing so caused the rain-soaked walls of the trench to collapse, killing both him and Tommy. In a claim for wrongful death by Tommy's administrator against Construction Company, the most likely result is that the plaintiff will\n\n(A) recover, because the defendant left the open trench unprotected\n(B) not recover, because Tommy's death was a result of the collapse of the trench, an independent intervening cause\n(C) not recover. because Tommy was a trespasser\n(D) recover, because construction companies are strictly liable for inherently dangerous conditions\n\nFinal Answer: ",

Contributory negligence is defined as “conduct on the part of the plaintiff which falls below the standard to which he should conform for his own protection and which is the legally contributing cause, cooperating with the negligence of the defendant, in bringing about the plaintiff's harm.” Guerra, 204 Kan. at 313, 461 P.2d 737.

Congress may impose the restriction that the instrumentality be entirely self-supporting, without any appropriated funds, in which case it is a NAFI. See, e.g., Core Concepts of Florida, Inc. v. United States, 327 F.3d 1331 (Fed.Cir.2003) (Federal Prison Industries is a NAFI); Furash & Co. v. United States, 252 F.3d 1336 (Fed.Cir.2001) (Federal Housing Finance Board is a NAFI). Or, Congress may direct an entity to be self sufficient, but leave open the possibility that appropriations may be applied. See, e.g., L'Enfant Plaza, 668 F.2d at 1212 (financial self-sufficiency does not establish NAFI where historically appropriations were received and are allowed under the statute for the future); Slattery v. United States, 53 Fed.Cl. 258 (Fed.Cl.2002) (FDIC Bank Insurance Fund is not a NAFI because Congress expressed willingness to appropriate funds, although it never has). Whether an agency or agency fund is a NAFI is determined by looking at the entirety of its financial wellspring, not by parsing its revenue stream to determine which moneys came from the Treasury and which from customer payments. Indeed, an entity is not treated as a NAFI even if all of its money flows from its own activities, and even if appropriated funds have never been used, so long as “under the agency's authorizing legislation Congress could appropriate *410 funds if necessary.”",

Express easements are written and are usually included in a deed or a will. The creation of an express easement is governed by contract law. In contrast to express easements, implied easements can arise over time as a result of circumstances that exist between the parties and the property. Easements are generally affirmative in nature- thus, they confer the right to use the servient land in some specific manner.\nCovenants. Covenants are written agreements in which the grantor promises to take or not take a certain action with respect to the land. Some covenants attach to the land and are applicable to all subsequent owners of the property. For such covenants to be enforceable, the covenant must be in writing and the new owner must receive adequate notification of the covenant. Other covenants expire when the property is transferred. Covenants typically exist in common interest developments, such as homeowners associations, to promote consistency in the appearance and operation of the development. Covenants of this nature are generally negative such that they restrict the actions and behavior of the consenting party with respect to his property. For example, in a homeowner’s association, members are subject to covenants that prohibit them from using certain paint colors or having pets in the home.\nLicenses. A license grants permission to a third party to use the property for a specific purpose.  Unlike an easement, the license granted to the licensee may be revoked at the discretion of the licensor unless the license is set forth in a written contract with a specified termination date. The exception to this rule exists when a licensee makes significant expenditures in reliance on the use granted by the license. In such a case, the license resembles an easement more than a license and can be deemed irrevocable.",

If no such person is identifiable, then the remainder is subject to a condition precedent and is a contingent remainder. In determining the type of remainder created, Georgia has consistently followed two common law principles: (a) the law favors construing “conditions to be subsequent” and (b) the law favors the “vesting of remainders in all cases of doubt,” which is also called the “early vesting” of remainders. Professor Chaffin has noted that “[a]lthough it is possible to create nondescendible defeasible remainders by using very clear conditions of survivorship by way of condition subsequent, it is difficult to do so in view of the preference for defeasibly vested rather than contingent interests.”",

Charged with committing the misdemeanor, Nelson testifies that he did a very poor job of keeping records and did not realize that his sales of prescription drugs had exceeded $50,000. If the jury believes Nelson, he should be found\n\n(A) guilty, because this is a public welfare offense\n(B) not guilty, because he was not aware of the value of the drugs he had sold\n(C) not guilty, because the statute punishes omissions and he was not given fair warning of his duty to act\n(D) guilty, because he cannot be excused on the basis of his own failure to keep proper records\n\nFinal Answer: ",

Under a claim of self-defense, a person must reasonably believe that the use of force is “immediately necessary” to protect himself against the other's use or attempted use of unlawful force. Under a claim of defense of a third person, a person must reasonably believe that his intervention is “immediately necessary” to protect the third person.

For example, fencing a road in a manner suitable for a highway and permitting the public to use it might constitute a dedication. Recording a plan and conveying lots in accordance with the plan, without any indication otherwise, also likely constitutes an intent to dedicate the streets shown on the plan to public use. Recording a plan and conveying lots in accordance with the plan, without any indication otherwise, also likely constitutes an intent to dedicate the streets shown on the plan to public use. On the other hand, granting the public a license to use a way for a limited period of time likely does not amount to a dedication. In addition, only an owner can dedicate a road, not a lessee or licensee.\n\nThe property owner is required to allow the entire public the use of the dedicated area. For example, the creation of a way connecting two lots owned by the same person which passed over a third lot owned by that person would not constitute an intention to dedicate the way to the public. Likewise, a covenant in a deed stating that title would revert if a building were ever constructed on certain land does not amount to a dedication.\n\nIn most cases, dedication of a street gives the public the immediate right of passage over the street. The reason for this conclusion requires an analysis of the distinction between public acceptance to use a dedicated street versus acceptance to maintain a street, addressed later in these materials. Dedication alone does not burden the municipality with the duty of maintenance unless the municipality accepts the dedication.",

Here both possession of the corpus and enjoyment of the income are postponed; unless the beneficiary lives to be twenty-one he will get neither. Whether his interest may be said to be ‘vested‘ or not is unimportant, for as indicated both in the committee reports and in the Regulations an interest ‘whether vested or contingent‘ is a ‘future interest‘, if it is limited to commence in possession or enjoyment at some future date. Nor is it important, if true, that the interest of the minor beneficiary may in some way be available to his creditors,2 for the availability of an interest for the satisfaction of claims of creditors is not inconsistent with its being a ‘future interest‘. See Restatement, supra, Secs. 166-169. As applied to the interests of a beneficiary under a trust, a ‘future interest‘ is used by way of contrast to a ‘present interest‘, which is characterized by the Restatement, supra, Sec. 153, as ‘the right to the immediate beneficial enjoyment of the proceeds of the trust‘.

When the International Order of Badgers came to town for its convention, its members rented 400 of the 500 rooms, and the hotel opened its convention facilities to them. Badgers are a rowdy group, and during their convention they littered both the inside and the outside of the hotel with debris and bottles. The hotel manager knew that objects were being thrown out of the hotel windows. At his direction, hotel employees patrolled the hallways telling the guests to refrain from such conduct. Ohner was out of town and was not aware of the problems which were occurring. During the convention, as Smith walked past the Acme Hotel on the sidewalk, he was hit and injured by an ashtray thrown out of a window in the hotel. Smith sued Ohner for damages for his injuries. Will Smith prevail in his claim against Ohner?\n\n(A) No, if the trier of fact determines that the hotel employees had taken reasonable precautions to prevent such an injury.\n(B) No, because Ohner had no personal knowledge of the conduct of the hotel guests.\n(C) Yes, because a property owner is strictly liable for acts on his premises if such acts cause harm to persons using the adjacent public sidewalks.\n(D) Yes, if the person who threw the ashtray cannot be identified.\n\nFinal Answer: ",

And even over public land within the States, “(t)he general government doubtless has a power over its own property analogous to the police power of the several states, and the extent to which it may go in the exercise of such power is measured by the exigencies of the particular case.” Camfield v. United States, supra, 167 U.S., at 525, 17 S.Ct., at 867. We have noted, for example, that the Property Clause gives Congress the power over the public lands “to control their occupancy and use, to protect them from trespass and injury, and to prescribe the conditions upon which others may obtain rights in them . . . .” Utah Power & Light Co. v. United States, 243 U.S. 389, 405, 37 S.Ct. 387, 389, 61 L.Ed. 791 (1917).

Although the Property Clause does not authorize “an exercise of a general control over public policy in a State,” it does permit “an exercise of the complete power which Congress has over particular public property entrusted to it.” United States v. San Francisco, supra, 310 U.S., at 30, 60 S.Ct., at 757. (footnote omitted).

In an action for a declaration of rights, it was claimed that the attempted gifts to Sallie's grandchildren were entirely void and that the interests following the life estates to Sallie's children passed to the children absolutely by the residuary clause. Assuming that the action was properly brought with all necessary parties and with a guardian ad item appointed to represent the interests of unborn and infant grandchildren, the decision should be that\n\n(A) the provisions concerning grandchildren are valid and will be upheld according to their terms\n(B) even if the provisions against sale or mortgage by the grandchildren are void, the remainders to grandchildren are otherwise valid and will be given effect\n(C) the attempted gifts to grandchildren are void as unlawful restraints on alienation\n(D) the attempted gifts to grandchildren are void under the Rule Against Perpetuities\n\nFinal Answer: ",

Whiteacre has no access to any public way except an old, poorly developed road which is inconvenient and cannot be used without great expense. White sold Whiteacre to Breyer. The description used in the deed from White to Breyer was the same as that used in prior deeds except that the portion of the description which formerly said, \"thence by land of Black, north-easterly a distance of 200 feet, more or less,\" was changed to \"thence by College Avenue as laid out on the Plan of Meadowview North 460 East 201.6 feet,\" with full reference to the plan and its recording data. Breyer now seeks a building permit which will show that Breyer intends to use College Avenue for access to Whiteacre. Black objects to the granting of a building permit on the grounds that he has never granted any rights to White or Breyer to use College Avenue. There are no governing statutes or ordinances relating to the problem. Black brings an appropriate action in which the right of Breyer to use College Avenue without an express grant from Black is at issue.",

But the division of power between federal and state governments remains controversial despite its long history. Consider the present debate over the U.S. Senate and the system for electing the president, which give disproportionate power to states with smaller populations. In white-collar criminal law, principles of federalism have influenced how the Supreme Court has interpreted the broadly-worded mail and wire fraud statutes, particularly in prosecutions of state and local officials, as we have previously discussed. See, e.g., Elkan Abramowitz & Jonathan Sack, Limits on the Scope of Honest Services Fraud, N.Y.L.J., Nov. 7, 2017. The Supreme Court has expressed reservations about federal prosecutors becoming excessively involved in the regulation of state and local political behavior.\n\nIn its present term, the Supreme Court will hear an appeal arising from the controversy known as “Bridgegate”: the politically-motivated closure in 2013 of two lanes on the George Washington Bridge that served Fort Lee, N.J. The government alleged that defendants Bridget Kelly and William Baroni Jr. ordered the lanes closed for political reasons which they concealed by falsely saying the closure was part of a “traffic study.” The Supreme Court granted certiorari to decide the defendants’ claim that the federal wire fraud statute should not be held to extend to the sharp-elbowed local politics underlying the prosecution. After describing the factual and legal background, we discuss the arguments of the defense and the government in the Supreme Court.

        "gold_passage": "The U.S. Constitution establishes a system of dual sovereignty between the states and the federal government, with each state having its own government, endowed with all the functions essential to separate and independent existence. Although the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution designates “the Laws of the United States” as “the supreme Law of the Land,” other provisions of the Constitution—as well as legal principles undergirding those provisions—nonetheless prohibit the national government from enacting certain types of laws that impinge upon state sovereignty. The various principles that delineate the proper boundaries between the powers of the federal and state governments are collectively known as “federalism.” Federalism-based restrictions that the Constitution imposes on the national government’s ability to enact legislation may inform Congress’s work in any number of areas of law in which the states and the federal government dually operate. There are two central ways in which the Constitution imposes federalism-based limitations on Congress’s powers. First, Congress’s powers are restricted by and to the terms of express grants of power in the Constitution, which thereby establish internal constraints on the federal government’s authority. The Constitution explicitly grants Congress a limited set of carefully defined enumerated powers, while reserving most other legislative powers to the states. As a result, Congress may not enact any legislation that exceeds the scope of its limited enumerated powers. That said, Congress’s enumerated powers nevertheless do authorize the federal government to enact legislation that may significantly influence the scope of power exercised by the states. For instance, subject to certain restrictions, Congress may utilize its taxing and spending powers to encourage states to undertake certain types of actions that Congress might otherwise lack the constitutional authority to undertake on its own. Similarly, the Supreme Court has interpreted the Constitution’s Commerce Clause to afford Congress substantial (but not unlimited) authority to regulate certain purely intrastate economic activitiesthat substantially affect interstate commerce in the aggregate. Congress may also enact certain types of legislation in order to implement international treaties. Additionally, pursuant to a collection of constitutional amendments ratified shortly after the Civil War, Congress may directly regulate the states in limited respects in order to prevent states from depriving persons of certain procedural and substantive rights. Finally, the Necessary and Proper Clause augments Congress’s enumerated powers by empowering the federal government to enact laws that are “necessary and proper” to execute its express powers.",

        "gold_passage": "The difficulty lies in the meaning to be assigned to foreseeable risk.  It has been noted that in determining whether certain events are within the risk created, the courts have been compelled of necessity to resort to hindsight rather than foresight. Restatement (Second) of Torts, § 281 comment g (1965). A post hoc step by step analysis, however, can render “foreseeable” almost anything that has in fact occurred. Cf. Petition of Kinsman Transit Company, 338 F.2d 708, 723 (1964). The courts have thus defined the foreseeable risk broadly:\nNot only is the concept of foreseeability itself elastic and capable of expansion, but also it is generally recognized that the particular manner in which the injury is brought about need not be foreseeable by any test. It has been well said, “The fact is, that the consequences of negligence are almost invariably surprises.” This concept is an antidote to the requirement that plaintiff be injured by one of the dangers or risks that made defendant's conduct negligent. There is often no hard and fast line between the risk or hazard (which must be foreseeable) and the manner in which an accident happens (which need not be). The tendency of these two notions to pull in opposite directions, therefore, both invites the courts to define the risk or hazard broadly, and also gives courts a choice to treat the freak case on an individualized basis.\n2 F. Harper and F. James, The Law of Torts, § 18.2 at 1026–27 (1956) (footnotes omitted) (quoting Chavers v. A.R. Blossman, 45 So.2d 398, 402 (La.App.1950)).\nOur supreme court has similarly defined the term “foreseeable risk” broadly:\nThe Palsgraf principle requires that liability be imposed only where both the plaintiff and the risk are foreseeable to a reasonable person. The holding here is that a broad view must be taken of the class of risks and victims that are foreseeable.\nMcFarlin v. Hall, 127 Ariz. 220, 222, 619 P.2d 729, 731 (1980).",

Thus, where a minister seeks redress for termination, failure to hire, changes in work schedule, or other similar decisions involving, at their heart, a church's core right to decide who (and in what manner he or she) may propagate its religious beliefs, the Establishment Clause clearly prevents review by a civil court.

        "gold_passage": "Had defendant's bid expressly stated or clearly implied that it was revocable at any time before acceptance we would treat it accordingly. It was silent on revocation, however, and we must therefore determine whether there are conditions to the right of revocation imposed by law or reasonably inferable in fact.  In the analogous problem of an offer for a unilateral contract, the theory is now obsolete that the offer is revocable at any time before complete performance. Thus section 45 of the Restatement of Contracts provides: ‘If an offer for a unilateral contract is made, and part of the consideration requested in the offer is given or tendered by the offeree in response thereto, the offeror is bound by a contract, the duty of immediate performance of which is conditional on the full consideration being given or tendered within the time stated in the offer, or, if no time is stated therein, within a reasonable time.’ In explanation, comment b states that the ‘main offer includes as a subsidiary promise, necessarily implied, that if part of the requested performance is given, the offeror will not revoke his offer, and that if tender is made it will be accepted. Part performance or tender may thus furnish consideration for the subsidiary promise. Moreover, merely acting in justifiable reliance on an offer may in some cases serve as sufficient reason for making a promise binding (see s 90).’\nWhether implied in fact or law, the subsidiary promise serves to preclude the injustice that would result if the offer could be revoked after the offeree had acted in detrimental reliance thereon.  Reasonable reliance resulting in a foreseeable prejudicial change in position affords a compelling basis also for implying a subsidiary promise not to revoke an offer for a bilateral contract.\nThe absence of consideration is not fatal to the enforcement of such a promise. It is true that in the case of unilateral contracts the Restatement finds consideration for the implied subsidiary promise in the part performance of the bargained-for exchange, but its reference to section 90 makes clear that consideration for such a promise is not always necessary. The very purpose of section 90 is to make a promise binding even though there was no consideration ‘in the sense of something that is bargained for and given in exchange.’ (See 1 Corbin, Contracts 634 et seq.) Reasonable reliance serves to hold the offeror in lieu of the consideration ordinarily required to make the offer binding. In a case involving similar facts the Supreme Court of South Dakota stated that ‘we believe that reason and justice demand that the doctrine (of section 90) be applied to the present facts. We cannot believe that by accepting this doctrine as controlling in the state of facts before us we will abolish the requirement of a consideration in contract *415 cases, in any different sense than an ordinary estoppel abolishes some legal requirement in its application. We are of the opinion, therefore, that the defendants in executing the agreement (which was not supported by consideration) made a promise which they should have reasonably expected would induce the plaintiff to submit a bid based thereon to the Government, that such promise did induce this action, and that injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.’ Northwestern Engineering Co. v. Ellerman, 69 S.D. 397, 408, 10 N.W.2d 879, 884; see also, Robert Gordon, Inc., v. Ingersoll-Rand Co., 7 Cir., 117 F.2d 654, 661; cf. James Baird Co. v. Gimbel Bros., 2 Cir., 64 F.2d 344.\nWhen plaintiff used defendant's offer in computing his own bid, he bound himself to perform in reliance on defendant's terms. Though defendant did not bargain for this use of its bid neither did defendant make it idly, indifferent to whether it would be used or not. On the contrary it is reasonable to suppose that defendant submitted its bid to obtain the subcontract. It was bound to realize the substantial possibility that its bid would be the lowest, and that it would be included by plaintiff in his bid. It was to its own interest that the contractor be awarded the general contract; the lower the subcontract bid, the lower the general contractor's bid was likely to be and the greater its cnance of acceptance and hence the greater defendant's chance of getting the paving subcontract. Defendant had reason not only to expect plaintiff to rely on its bid but to want him to. Clearly defendant had a stake in plaintiff's reliance on its bid. Given this interest and the fact that plaintiff is bound by his own bid, it is only fair that plaintiff should have at least an opportunity to accept defendant's bid after the general contract has been awarded to him.",

In 1960 and 1961 commercial buildings and parking facilities were constructed on one,RoyalCenter, in accordance with the plans disclosed by the plat for each subdivision. Royal Center continues to be used for commercial purposes. The plat of the other, Royal Oaks, showed 250 lots, streets, and utility and drainage easements. All of the lots in Royal Oaks were conveyed during 1960 and 1961. The deeds contained provisions, expressly stated to be binding upon the grantee, his heirs and assigns, requiring the lots to be used only for single-family, residential purposes until 1985. The deeds expressly stated that these provisions were enforceable by the owner of any lot in the Royal Oaks subdivision. At all times since 1959, the 200 acres in Royal Center have been zoned for shopping center use, and the 200 acres in Royal Oaks have been zoned for residential use in a classification which permits both single-family and multiplefamily use.",

Vest, BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014); see also Peveto, 645 S.W.2d at 772. The Rule does not apply to present or future interests that vest at their creation. Laddex, 513 S.W.3d at 480.  An executory interest is a future interest, held by a third person, that either cuts off another's interest or begins after the natural termination of a preceding estate. Executory Interest, BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014). A springing executory interest is one that operates to end an interest left in the transferor. Springing Executory Interest, BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014); accord Peveto, 645 S.W.2d at 772. This interest does not vest at the execution of the deed, rather “executory interests vest an estate in the holder of the interest upon the happening of a condition or event.” 3 RICHARD R. POWELL, POWELL ON REAL PROPERTY § 20.05[2] (Michael Allan Wolf ed.). “Until such happening, they are non-vested future interests” and are subject to the Rule. Id. In contrast, a possibility of reverter is a future interest held by the grantor and is not subject to the Rule because it vests at the moment of creation. El Dorado Land Co., L.P. v. City of McKinney, 395 S.W.3d 798, 802–03 (Tex. 2013); see Luckel v. White, 819 S.W.2d 459, 464 (Tex. 1991). A possibility of reverter is “the grantor's right to fee ownership in the real property reverting to him if the condition terminating the determinable fee occurs.” Luckel, 819 S.W.2d at 464. This interest is properly viewed as a “claim[ ] to property that the grantor never gave away.” El Dorado Land Co., L.P., 395 S.W.3d at 802–03 (citing 3 POWELL ON REAL PROPERTY § 20.02[1] ).T",

City of Eugene, 336 Or. 181, 81 P.3d 702 (2003), the court concluded that ORS 28.020—which allows a person to seek a declaratory judgment if the person’s rights “are affected by a constitution, statute, municipal charter, ordinance, contract or franchise”—codifies a ripeness requirement for justiciability of a declaratory relief action. 336 Or. at 191, 81 P.3d 702; see also Beck, 202 Or. App. at 366, 122 P.3d 131 (describing U.S. West Communications as “appl[ying] the test for ripeness set out in [two prior cases] in which the court explicitly identified ripeness as a jurisdictional issue”). “[T]he legislature’s use of the present tense phrase ‘are affected’ implies [that] the controversy must involve a dispute based on present facts rather than on contingent or hypothetical events.” U.S. West Communications, 336 Or. at 191, 81 P.3d 702.

Appellant argues that only a final order, signed by a judge, is admissible as a “record of conviction.” The Commonwealth contends that the statute should not be so narrowly construed. This is an issue of first impression. Nothing in the plain language of Code § 19.2-295.1 requires that a “record of conviction” be established only by the admission of a final order of conviction. The language of Code § 19.2-295.1 describes a “record,” not an “order.” The plain meaning of the word “record” is\n[a] written account of some act, court proceeding, transaction, or instrument, drawn up, under authority of law, by a proper officer, and designed to remain as a memorial or permanent evidence of the matters to which it relates. Black's Law Dictionary 1144 (5th ed.1979).  Thus, we find that “record of conviction” means a “record” evidencing the fact of conviction. While a final order of conviction may be the most expedient means of establishing a “record of conviction,” we do not find Code § 19.2-295.1 limited to such evidence.",

Inadequate maintenance can give rise to a slip and fall, negligent security, or a swimming pool accident. Some typical types of inadequate maintenance include unrepaired fixtures, fallen merchandise, spills, broken windows, cracked sidewalks or tiles, broken locks, lack of security cameras, loose handrails, cluttered walkways, and overgrown vegetation. Duty to Inspect\nOwners or occupiers typically have a duty to inspect their property at reasonable intervals to discover dangerous conditions, regardless of whether they receive complaints. All property owners are expected to maintain their properties and make reasonable repairs to avoid injuries to visitors to the property. However, in practice, property owners are often behind in inspecting, identifying, and fixing any dangerous conditions. It is only after someone is actually injured that the property owner takes steps to repair a dangerous condition or obtain adequate security. For example, customers may complain that there are broken lights near the entrance of a dance club, but it may be only after somebody is mugged or raped that the property owner fixes the broken lights. Condominiums or homeowners' associations can also be held liable for failing to maintain a common area or to keep the common area clear of preventable hazards. The paperwork that creates the condominium board or homeowners' association may spell out the obligations of that entity on the property. Among other things, it may define common areas for which the entity is responsible. Liability is usually found if the condominium or homeowners' association created the hazard, or if it knew or should have known of the hazard. For example, the owners of individual units may complain to the condominium or homeowners' association that steps on the ladder of the common swimming pool are broken. If the condominium board fails to make repairs or makes repairs negligently, and somebody is injured, the board may have to pay damages.",

Marriner, 187 N.C. 449, 457, 121 S.E. 770, 774 (1924); 51 Am.Jur.2d, supra, § 255; 1 Tiffany, supra, § 68. The life tenant's purchase at a tax sale \"is regarded as a payment of the tax, and the owner of the future interest is regarded as still holding under his original title.\" Simes and Smith, The Law of Future Interests, § 1700 (2d ed. 1956). In addition to the taxes, absent a different stipulation in the instrument creating the life estate, a life tenant owes a duty to the remaindermen to pay the interest accruing during the period of his estate on a mortgage encumbrance given prior to the creation of the life estate and remainder or reversion, at least to the extent of the income or rental value of the property. Simes and Smith, supra, § 1697. See 31 C.J.S. Estates § 48 (1964); 51 Am.Jur.2d, supra, § 277. \"Being bound to pay the taxes and interest, he [a life tenant] cannot acquire a tax title or good title based on his failing to pay taxes or interest. He is a trustee to this extent.\" Miller v. Marriner, supra at 457, 121 S.E. at 774. If an encumbrance is foreclosed because of the default on the part of the life tenant in the payment of interest or otherwise, and he becomes the purchaser at the foreclosure sale, \"he thereby restores the life estate and the estate in the remainder.\" 1 Tiffany, supra § 68. See Morehead v. Harris, 262 N.C. 330, 338, 137 S.E.2d 174, 182 (1964); Restatement of Property §§ 129, 130, 131, 149 (1936); 31 C.J.S. Estates § 35 (1964). In respect to a prior mortgage lien on the whole estate, unless obligated by the instrument creating his estate, the life tenant's only duty to the remainderman is to pay the interest. He is under no obligation to pay any part of the principal. 31 C.J.S. Estates § 48 (1964); 51 Am.Jur.2d, supra, § 275. When a life tenant, in order to preserve his estate, \"pays off an encumbrance upon the fee or estate property, whether the encumbrance is a mortgage, lien, charge or other type of encumbrance, he is entitled to reimbursement from the owners of future interests, such as reversioners or remaindermen, to the extent of their interest in the property which was subject to the encumbrance.\" 51 Am. Jur.2d, supra, § 275. See 31 C.J.S. Estates § 48 (1964); 1 Tiffany, supra, § 63. He \"has a lien on the future interest for the amount which its owner is under a duty to pay.\" Simes and Smith, supra, § 1697. See Farabow v. Perry, supra, 223 N.C. at 26, 25 S.E.2d at 176; Creech v. Wilder, supra, 212 N.C. at 166, 193 S.E. at 284. When a mortgage falls due during the period of the life estate the question arises: Who has the burden of paying the principal? In Simes and Smith, The Law of Future Interests, § 1697 (2d ed. 1956), the question is answered as follows: \"Courts have generally indicated that life tenant and reversioner or remainderman must each pay his due proportion of this amount. To require them to share the burden would seem to be just. By paying off the mortgage, the value of both life estate and future interest have been increased in proportion to their respective values. Hence it would seem that the due proportion would be based upon the respective values of life estate and the remainder or reversion.. . . The cases, however, are not clear as to what a due proportion of the principal is.\" The foregoing statement accords with the Restatement of Property § 132 (1936). Explanatory Comment e. under this section says that the proportionate contributions of the life estate and future interests to the payment of an encumbrance \"are computable by employing the mortality tables and rate of interest regularly employed in valuing an estate for life in the state wherein the affected land is located.\" Id. at p. 433. See Faulkenburg v. Windorf, 194 Minn. 154, 157, 259 N.W. 802, 804 (1935). In Comment a. to § 132, supra, it is noted that absent some special provision in the instrument creating the estate for life, the life tenant has no duty to contribute from his other assets to the payment of the encumbrance. \"He can, however, be compelled to choose between giving up his estate for life and making a contribution, from his other assets, to the new investment of capital.\" Id. at p. 431. When a mortgage, deed of trust or other encumbrance on the whole estate, the burden of which does not fall solely on the life tenant, is foreclosed, the life tenant may purchase the property at the sale in order to protect his interest. Yet he cannot purchase the fee on a foreclosure sale so as to exclude the remainderman if the remainderman is willing to contribute his share of the cost of acquisition within a reasonable time. \"It is uniformly held that the purchase of land by a life tenant at a foreclosure sale under a mortgage or deed of trust will be deemed to have been made for the benefit of the remainderman or reversioner *745 if he contributes his portion of the purchase money within a reasonable time.\" 51 Am. Jur.2d supra, § 280. See Witcher v. Hanley, 299 Mo. 696, 253 S.W. 1002 (1923); Hager v. Connolly, 204 Ky. 147, 263 S.W. 723 (1924); Ward v. Chambless, 238 Ala. 165, 189 So. 890 (1939); Drane v.

The father was prosecuted for murder, defined in the jurisdiction as \"unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought.\" The father should be\n\n(A) acquitted, because summoning the physician or feeding the child would not have prevented the child's death from cancer\n(B) acquitted, because of the defendant's goodfaith belief concerning parental rights in supervising children\n(C) convicted, because the child would have died from malnutrition had he not been afflicted with cancer\n(D) convicted, because the father's treatment of his son showed a reckless indifference to the value of life\n\nFinal Answer: ",

During the term of the lease, Rogers verbally invited Andrews to share the house with the lessees. Andrews agreed to pay part of the rent to Lane, who did not object to this arrangement, despite a provision in the lease that provided that \"any assignment, subletting or transfer of any rights under this lease without the express written consent of the landlord is strictly prohibited, null, and void.\" Talbot objected to Andrews' moving in, even if Andrews were to pay a part of the rent. When Andrews moved in, Talbot brought an appropriate action against Lane, Rogers, and Andrews for a declaratory judgment that Rogers had no right to assign. Rogers' defense was that he and Talbot were tenants in common of a term for years, and that he, Rogers, had a right to assign a fractional interest in his undivided one-half interest. In this action, Talbot will\n\n(A) not prevail, because his claim amounts to a void restraint on alienation\n(B) prevail, because the lease provision prohibits assignment\n(C) prevail, because a co-tenant has no right to assign all or any part of a leasehold without the consent of all interested parties\n(D) not prevail, because he is not the beneficiary of the nonassignment provision in the lease\n\nFinal Answer: ",

See also, Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 71, comment b at 173 (1981) (“ ‘Bargained for.’ In the typical bargain, the consideration and the promise bear a reciprocal relation of motive or inducement: the consideration induces the making of the promise and the promise induces the furnishing of the consideration.”).",

Unlike substantive evidence which is offered for the purpose of persuading the trier of fact as to the truth of a proposition on which the determination of the tribunal is to be asked, impeachment is that which is designed to discredit a witness, i. e., to reduce the effectiveness of his testimony by bringing forth evidence which explains why the jury should not put faith in him or his testimony. Examples of impeachment evidence would include prior inconsistent statements, bias, attacks on character of a witness, prior felony convictions, and attacks on the capacity of the witness to observe, recall or relate. See Udall, Arizona Law of Evidence, §§ 61–69, pp. 79–112.\nEvidence may be both substantive and impeaching. In our earlier hypothetical of the surveillance movie, the movie may be substantive proof of the plaintiff's injuries or lack thereof and it may be used to discredit her testimony. Another example would be evidence that a party was intoxicated. It is substantive evidence of negligence or contributory negligence and it also serves to discredit this party.",

        "gold_passage": "In real estate, the chain of title is the history of the property’s ownership. When a property is sold, the title is transferred, and these transfers form the chain. Researching the chain of title is among the tasks performed by a title company when a buyer signs a contract to purchase a property. The chain of title for any property is found in the relevant county recorder’s office, and there’s no reason you can’t conduct your own search to determine the chain of title. All the information is in the public record. Keep in mind that state laws governing the recording of real estate transfers differ, so the chain of title process in one state may differ somewhat from the chain of title process in another. \nChain of Title Documents Formal documents maintain the chain of title. The chain ends with the most recent document affecting the property. Types of documents included are:\nTransfer Documents\nFinancial Documents\nInvoluntary Liens\nCovenants and Restrictions\nEasements\nTransfer documents (deeds) document the transfer of ownership. The deed conveys the property from the seller, or grantor, to the buyer, or grantee. The deed also includes a detailed description of the property.Financial documents (mortgages and deeds of trust) are voluntary liens, as the creditor enters into an agreement with a lender to borrow money to purchase the property. Until the debt is paid off, generally in 15 or 30 years, the lender has title to the property. Once the mortgage is paid, the former creditor owns the property “free and clear.” The date of the mortgage or lien determines which lien is a priority for payment if there is more than one lien in competition. A deed of trust, also known as a trust deed, assigns the property to a trustee. The trustee holds the title as security for a loan between the lender and the borrower. In such a case, the lender is known as the beneficiary and the borrower as the trustor.\nInvoluntary lien documents include liens, lis pendens and tax liens. Involuntary liens, as the name implies, are liens that arise without the owner’s consent, usually due to nonpayment of debts. Examples of involuntary liens include property tax liens when local property taxes are not paid; income tax liens, for failure to pay the IRS; judgment liens from a creditor, ordered by the court, and mechanic’s liens. The latter is filed by contractors if the owner does not pay for work done on the property. Involuntary liens “cloud” the title and require payment before the property changes hands. In some cases, the property is sold at auction to satisfy the lien. A lis pendens is notice that a lawsuit has been filed regarding the property’s title or ownership.\nCovenants and restrictions are documents creating restrictions on the use of the subject property. Such restrictions may include limits on the types of improvements made to the property, uses of the property and property occupancy. Older homes may have covenants not permitting the sale of the property to people of certain racial or religious backgrounds, but these covenants are no longer enforceable.\nEasements, also known as rights of way, are documents affecting usage rights. There are various types of easements, including:\nUtility easements — allowing utility companies access to the property for the purpose of maintaining electrical lines, water/sewer lines and the like. These are the most common types of easements and affect most properties.\nPrivate easements — a private easement allows another party, usually a neighbor, access through the property. It may mean direct access, such as a shared driveway, or non-direct access. An example of the latter is solar access, which means the owner cannot build or plant anything on the property that would affect a neighbor’s solar collection.\nEasement by necessity — in some situations, the only way a neighboring landowner can access their property is by going through an adjacent property. This is known as easement by necessity, and the property owner cannot interfere with the neighbor’s ability to access his or her land.\nOther documents involved in the chain of title may include:\nDeath certificates, when the property passes to a joint tenant through the right of survivorship. This joint tenant is generally the decedent’s spouse.\nAffidavits, documents that affirm a fact related to the property\nCorrection deeds, used to correct an error in a previously recorded document\nChain of Title Breaks\nSometimes, there is a break in the chain of title. This occurs if the title transfer was inaccurate – or fraudulent. Human error is often to blame, especially if paperwork is filed in haste. That’s often the case during real estate booms, when lawyers and lenders were simply overwhelmed by the sheer amount of business. Common errors include misspellings of names of the grantor or grantee, incorrect legal descriptions of the property, lack of signatures on the deed, mistakes in when the chain of title documents were recorded, and even filing the deed in the wrong county. When there is a break in the chain of title, correction is necessary. The simplest ways to correct such breaks is to have the property owner go to court and seek quiet title action. Depending on the nature of the break, a judge can rule that the break is not relevant and no longer exists. However, if the break is known to have resulted due to a particular party, the owner can seek out the party and have them fill out a quitclaim deed, which gives up any rights to the property they may have had.\nWhen it comes to chain of title and foreclosures, any break in the chain of title is a possible defense by an attorney for a foreclosed property owner.

        "gold_answer": "D",
        "gold_passage": "The US Constitution contains ambiguities regarding the roles of Congress and the President in making foreign policy. In practice, strong Presidents and legislators have often asserted their prerogatives in this area at the expense of the other. A case in point is the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review legislation, whereby Congress is insisting on approving the final agreement despite opposition by the Obama Administration. The debate over foreign policy powers arises from the language of the US Constitution that gives the President the power to make treaties and nominate Ambassadors and Executive Department leaders, with the advice and consent of the Senate. In addition to these responsibilities, the President acts as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and has the duty to receive Ambassadors and other public ministers from abroad. Since World War II, these powers have generally been interpreted as giving the President primacy in the conduct of US foreign policy. The Senate’s important role in the ratification of treaties and in approving Ambassadorial nominations and high ranking Executive Branch officials also is explicitly contained in the US Constitution. Other Constitutional sources of congressional power in foreign policy making include (1) the responsibility for appropriating all government monies, including foreign assistance; (2) the power to declare war under Article 1, Section 8 of the US Constitution and (3) the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations. Congress has used these powers to claim the right to limit or guide the President’s foreign policy, and on occasion has tried to initiate its own policies. The actions of Congress regarding foreign policy have drawn criticism from all presidents as meddling in presidential affairs. An example of congressional-presidential conflict over foreign policy powers is the debate that occurred over the use of US troops to liberate Kuwait following Iraq’s invasion in 1990. A group of House members sought a preliminary injunction in US Court to prevent George H.W.Bush from ordering US troops into offensive combat without specific congressional authorization. The court, however, was reluctant to become embroiled in war-making disputes between Legislative and Executive branches and refused the request. Ultimately, President Bush requested and Congress approved a resolution authorizing the use of military force to liberate Kuwait. A more recent example of Presidential-Congressional conflict occurred in 2002 when President George W. Bush received congressional approval for the use of force against Iraq in 2002. He used this approval to invade Iraq in early 2003. What appears to be lost is the congressional requirement to declare war. This requirement is being replaced by resolutions authorizing military activities. In effect, Congress is ceding its constitutional authority to declare war to the President. The Congress has made clear its desire that any military action in Syria or Iran require a congressional resolution authorizing the use of force against ISIL. The Administration broadly interprets the 2002 resolution as allowing the use of force to fight terrorism, while Congress insists the authority is limited to Iraq and wants a new resolution against ISIL. This is an on-going debate within Congress and there have been legislative moves that would replace the War Powers Act, but so far Congress has not acted on the legislation. By far, however, Congress’s greatest authority over US foreign policy is its “power of the purse”. Since Congress is given the sole power to appropriate monies, Constitutional experts believe Congress possesses the power to determine how money can be used. This determination can be expressed as a policy applicable to the use of funds or as a restriction or limitation on the use of funds. Congress’s power to determine whether or not to fund a particular country or program significantly affects US foreign policy.",

Therefore, personal services are more greatly valued than general labor. A contract for personal services usually imposes a duty to render the service, as well as a duty to forbear from rendering the service to a competitor. Some example of individuals who can perform personal services are actors, singers, athletes. \n\nAccording to the Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 367, “a promise to render personal service will not be specifically enforced” and “a promise to render personal service exclusively for one employer will not be enforced by an injunction against serving another if its probable result will be to compel a performance involving personal relations the enforced continuance of which is undesirable or will be to leave the employee without other reasonable means of making a living.” The rationale for this refusal to require specific performance of a personal services contract is that it would not be desirable to further personal associations between parties if there have already been disputes leading to a loss of confidence and loyalty. In addition, the quality of the personal services performance may be lowered if an individual’s sole motivation for performing is because he or she compelled to fulfill a contract obligation under law, but quality of performance is difficult to judge and quantify.",

With notions of fairness and finality in mind, the Framers of the Constitution included the Double Jeopardy Clause to prevent the government from trying or punishing a defendant more than once. Specifically, double jeopardy protects against:\na prosecution for the same offense after an acquittal\na prosecution for the same offense after a conviction, and\nmore than one punishment for the same offense.\nA defendant facing any of these scenarios can hold up the Double Jeopardy Clause as a shield.\nThere are clear instances when this shield is available, such as when a jury has acquitted a defendant and the state brings the same charges a second time. (If the prosecution discovered new evidence of the defendant's guilt after the initial trial, too bad.) Double jeopardy also bars punishment in certain prototypical scenarios—for example, when a judge tries to resentence someone who has already served the punishment for the crime in question.\nBut there's often not an obvious answer as to whether the Double Jeopardy Clause applies. Certain principles guide courts in making the determination.",

The probate-avoidance part of joint tenancy works only at the death of the first co-owner. (Or, if there are three joint tenants, only at the death of the first two, and so on.) When the last co-owner dies, the property must go through probate before it goes to whomever inherits it, unless the last owner used a different probate-avoidance method, such as transferring the property to a living trust. By contrast, some other probate-avoidance devices, such as living trusts or payable-on-death accounts, let you name a beneficiary who will inherit free of probate when the second co-owner dies.\nProbate is not avoided if both owners die simultaneously. In that very unlikely event, each owner's share of the property would pass under the terms of his or her will. If a joint tenant died without a valid will, the property would go to each owner's closest relatives under state law. Either way, probate would probably be necessary.\nOne owner's incapacity may hobble the others. If one joint owner became incapacitated and could not make decisions, the other owners' freedom to act would be restricted. This problem can be avoided if each joint owner signs a document called a \"Durable Power of Attorney,\" giving someone authority to manage their affairs if they cannot, or if the property is transferred to a living trust.",

Digger then called Wirth, the contractor of thirty years before, to testify that Pike had brought suit against Wirth for defects in the earlier house, many of which were like those now claimed to be found in the home Digger built but that the case was settled without trial.

Compensatory damages (also called “actual damages”) cover the loss the nonbreaching party incurred as a result of the breach of contract. The amount awarded is intended to make good or replace the loss caused by the breach.\nThere are two kinds of compensatory damages that the nonbreaching party may be entitled to recover:\nA. General Damages. General damages cover the loss directly and necessarily incurred by the breach of contract. General damages are the most common type of damages awarded for breaches of contract.\nExample: Company A delivered the wrong kind of furniture to Company B. After discovering the mistake later in the day, Company B insisted that Company A pick up the wrong furniture and deliver the right furniture. Company A refused to pick up the furniture and said that it could not supply the right furniture because it was not in stock. Company B successfully sued for breach of contract. The general damages for this breach could include:\n• refund of any amount Company B had prepaid for the furniture; plus \n• reimbursement of any expense Company B incurred in sending the furniture back to Company A; plus\n• payment for any increase in the cost Company B incurred in buying the right furniture, or its nearest equivalent, from another seller.\nB. Special Damages. Special damages (also called “consequential damages”) cover any loss incurred by the breach of contract because of special circumstances or conditions that are not ordinarily predictable. These are actual losses caused by the breach, but not in a direct and immediate way. To obtain damages for this type of loss, the nonbreaching party must prove that the breaching party knew of the special circumstances or requirements at the time the contract was made.\nExample: In the scenario above, if Company A knew that Company B needed the new furniture on a particular day because its old furniture was going to be carted away the night before, the damages for breach of contract could include all of the damages awarded in the scenario above, plus:\n• payment for Company B’s expense in renting furniture until the right furniture arrived.",

The court should hold the state tax, as applied here, to be\n\n(A) constitutional because private contractors performing work under a federal contract are not immune in these circumstances from nondiscriminatory state taxation\n(B) unconstitutional because it imposes an undue burden on interstate commerce\n(C) constitutional because a state has exclusive jurisdiction over all commercial transactions executed wholly within its borders\n(D) unconstitutional because it violates the supremacy clause\n\nFinal Answer: ",

        "gold_passage": "“Not guilty by reason of insanity” is a plea entered by a defendant in a criminal trial, where the defendant claims that they were so mentally disturbed or incapacitated at the time of the offense that they did not have the required intention to commit the crime, and are therefore not guilty. The Bouvier Law Dictionary explains that not guilty by reason of insanity is a plea “essentially admitting the defendant committed the act of the offense yet denying responsibility because the defendant lacked the capacity to act with criminal intent at the time.” It can also be a verdict entered by a jury in a criminal case, stating that the defendant cannot be held guilty because of the defendant’s insanity (however, such a verdict may require the defendant to be admitted into a mental institution).\n The defense of “not guilty by reason of insanity” goes to the concept of mens rea. Most offenses have two components: actus reus and mens rea. Actus reus is the requirement that the individual must have committed the criminal act and mens rea is the requirement that the individual have the required mental state, such as negligence, recklessness, etc. when committing the crime. Under this framework, a defendant can plead that they did not have the required mens rea for the crime because they were insane at the time they committed the crime, i.e. their insanity negated their culpability in the crime. For example, the crime of intentional murder requires that an individual have killed the victim intentionally. However, if the individual makes a showing that they were insane at the time they committed the murder and therefore could not have committed it “intentionally,” the individual may be deemed as not-guilty. Insanity is classified as an excuse defense. Principle behind the defense is that the behavior of a defendant who is not acting as a free moral agent is not worthy of social condemnation through the institution of punishment. To prove legal insanity, defendants usually put forth expert testimony on their psychological evaluation. Various jurisdictions use various test to judge such pleas (for example, cognitive test, irresistible impulse test, substantial capacity test, etc.). Compare with “guilty but mentally ill.”",

The contract provided for specified progress payments and a final payment of $40,000 upon Homey's acceptance of the house and issuance of a certificate of final approval by the architect. Further, under a \"liquidated damages\" clause in the agreement, Structo promised to pay Homey $500 for each day's delay in completing the house after the following October 1.

As with the first prong, courts will generally defer to the parties if the parties stipulate that the amount of liquidated damages is a reasonable estimate of the damages that will likely result from delays to project completion.  If such a stipulation exists, this will be difficult to overcome, so contractors and subcontractors should refuse to sign such a stipulation if you believe the amount of liquidated damages is unreasonable.\n\nNext, because liquidated damages are meant to approximate actual damages, courts will consider whether the liquidated damages amount is based on a reasonable estimate of actual damages made by the owner or contractor, or whether the liquidated damages amount was simply a random arbitrary amount.  Lastly, the court will look to whether liquidated damages are shockingly disproportionate to actual damages.  Courts have held that liquidated damages twice the amount of actual damages were reasonably proportionate to actual damages.

        "gold_passage": "Penal Law § 20.00 provides that a person may be held criminally liable as an accomplice when he performs certain acts and does so “with the mental culpability required for the commission” of the substantive crime. Despite this language, defendant argues, based on case law predating the present Penal Law, that even though the substantive crime with which he was charged--criminal sale of a controlled substance--requires only knowledge, the statute should be construed to require proof of a more exacting mens rea, namely specific intent to sell.\nUnder section 2 of the former Penal Law, a person could be convicted as a principal if he “aid[ed] and abett[ed] in [the]commission [of a crime]”. The former Penal Law, however, did not specifically state what type of acts were required for conviction (see, Denzer & McQuillan, Practice Commentary, McKinney's Cons Law of NY, Book 39, Penal Law art 20, at 32 [1967]; 7 Zett, New York Criminal Practice ¶ 62.1 [2]). Consequently, in order to prevent the imposition of criminal liability for the principal's crime on someone who may have been merely present, the courts required proof that the aider or abetter “ 'share[d] the intent or purpose of the principal actor' ” (People v La Belle, 18 NY2d 405, 412, quoting 1 Burdick, Crimes § 221, at 297; see, People v Morhouse, 21 NY2d 66, 73-74 [accomplice had knowledge of and shared guilty purposes of principle]; People v Fasano, 11 NY2d 436, 443 [accomplice must be “engaged in a common purpose or design”]; see also, Comment, Jury Instructions in Aiding and Abetting Cases, 68 Colum L Rev 774, 777-780).\nDefendant's argument is that this “shared intent or purpose” test required proof, in his case, that he acted with the specific intent to sell cocaine. However, any lack of clarity that previously existed under section 2 of the former Penal Law was eliminated by the adoption of section 20.00 of the revised Penal Law, which specifies that an accomplice must have acted with the “mental culpability required for the commission” of the particular crime. Further, we have already construed section 20.00 as not requiring specific intent within the meaning of Penal Law § 15.05 (1) when the substantive crime does not involve such intent (see, People v Flayhart, 72 NY2d 737, 741). Finally, the “shared intent or purpose” language from our earlier cases, which appears occasionally even in cases arising under the modern statute (see, e.g., People v Allah, 71 NY2d 830, 831 [“community of purpose”]; People v Cummings, 131 AD2d 865; People v McLean, 107 AD2d 167, 169, affd 65 NY2d 758), cannot be read for the proposition, advanced by defendant, that a specific wish to commit the principal's substantive crime is required in all circumstances, including those involving substantive crimes with mental states other than that defined in Penal Law § 15.05 (1). Indeed, the “shared intent or purpose” test set forth in the case law merely establishes that acts undertaken in relative innocence and without a conscious design to advance the principal's crime will not support a conviction for accomplice liability. The same conclusion, however, is implicit in the specific requirement in Penal Law § 20.00 that the accomplice “solicit[ ], request [ ], command[ ], importune[ ], or intentionally aid[ ]” (emphasis added) the principal, since all of the delineated acts import goal-directed conduct (see, 7 Zett, New York Criminal Practice ¶ 62.1 [2]).",

Immediately thereafter, Baker's daughter sold Lot 2 to Charles at the then fair market value of Lot 2. The sale was completed by the delivery of deed and payment of the purchase price. At no time did Baker or his daughter offer to sell Lot 2 to Aris. Aris learned of the conveyance to Baker's daughter and the sale by Baker's daughter to Charles one week after the conveyance of Lot 2 from Baker's daughter to Charles. Aris promptly brought an appropriate action against Charles to enforce rights created in him by the deed of Aris to Baker. Aris tendered the amount paid by Charles into the court for whatever disposition the court deemed proper. The common-law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified by statute. Which of the following will determine whether Aris will prevail? I. The parol evidence rule. II. The Statute of Frauds. III. The type of recording statute of the jurisdiction in question. IV. The Rule Against Perpetuities.\n\n(A) I only.\n(B) IV only.\n(C) II and III only.\n(D) I and IV only.\n\nFinal Answer: ",

        "gold_passage": "Montgomery is the seminal case on the admissibility of earlier convictions for the impeachment of a testifying witness. Before Montgomery, a defendant's earlier conviction of “an infamous crime” could be admitted to impeach his testimony. See, for example, People v. Davis, 412 Ill. 391, 402, 107 N.E.2d 607 (1952). The supreme court in Montgomery limited the admission of earlier crimes as impeachment when it found that the defendant's 21–year–old conviction “bore no rational relationship to the defendant's present credibility, and should not have been admitted.” Montgomery, 47 Ill.2d at 511, 268 N.E.2d 695. The court adopted the then-proposed draft of the Federal Rule of Evidence 609. See Montgomery, 47 Ill.2d at 516, 268 N.E.2d 695; Cox, 195 Ill.2d at 383, 254 Ill.Dec. 720, 748 N.E.2d 166. Evidence of a past conviction could be admitted to attack the credibility of a witness, “ ‘but only if the crime, (1) was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year * * * or (2) involved dishonesty or false statement regardless of the punishment unless (3), in either case, the judge determines that the probative value of the evidence of the crime is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.’ ” Montgomery, 47 Ill.2d at 516, 268 N.E.2d 695, quoting 51 F.R.D. 315, 391. Evidence of a conviction could not be admitted if more than 10 years had passed since the witness was convicted or released from confinement. Montgomery, 47 Ill.2d at 516, 268 N.E.2d 695. The third part of the test, balancing the probative value of an earlier conviction with its unfairly prejudicial effect, was considered to be the most important feature of the rule.  Montgomery, 47 Ill.2d at 517, 268 N.E.2d 695. The factors to be considered in the balancing test included the nature of the earlier crimes, the length of the defendant's criminal record, his age and circumstances, whether *970 it was more important for the jury to hear the defendant's version of the facts than to know of his earlier conviction, the nearness or remoteness of the earlier conviction, the defendant's career after the conviction and whether the earlier crime was similar to the one charged. Montgomery, 47 Ill.2d at 518, 268 N.E.2d 695. The interests of the defendant were to be balanced against the interests of the public. Montgomery, 47 Ill.2d at 518, 268 N.E.2d 695.",

The statute contains an inseverable condition requiring that any courthouse restored with the aid of such a grant must be equipped with ramps and other facilities necessary to accommodate physically handicapped people. A law of the state of Blue requires public buildings in Blue to have ramps and other facilities for handicapped people. It exempts from those requirements any building that is more than 70 years old if the State Board of Architects finds that the installation of such facilities would destroy the architectural integrity of the building. The Red County Courthouse in the state of Blue was built in 1895 and is still in use. It does not contain ramps or other special facilities for handicapped people. The State Board of Architects has determined that the installation of those facilities would destroy the architectural integrity of the building. Nevertheless, the County Board of Red County applies for a federal grant to restore and preserve that county's courthouse. If the County Board of Red County restores the Red County Courthouse with the aid of a federal restoration and preservation grant, is the board bound to install ramps and other facilities for handicapped people in that building?\n\n(A) Yes, because the rights of handicapped and disabled people are fundamental rights that take precedence, as a constitutional matter, over considerations of architectural integrity.\n(B) No, because any acceptance of this condition by the Red County Board of Supervisors would, as a matter of law, be considered to be under duress.\n(C) Yes, because Congress may impose reasonable conditions related to the public welfare on grants of federal funds to public bodies when the public bodies are free to accept or reject the grants.\n(D) No, because the Constitution does not authorize the federal government to direct the actions of the states or any of their political subdivisions with respect to matters affecting their own governmental buildings.\n\nFinal Answer: ",

Probative value is the measure of the importance of that tendency to the outcome of a case. It is the weight that a piece of relevant evidence will carry in helping the trier of fact decide the issues. “[T]he more essential the evidence, the greater its probative value.” United States v. Stout, 509 F.3d 796, 804 (6th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, a court analyzing probative value considers the importance of the evidence and the significance of the issues to which the evidence relates. As our supreme court stated in State v. Torres, 390 S.C. 618, 703 S.E.2d 226 (2010), “[p]hotographs calculated to arouse the sympathy or prejudice of the jury should be excluded if they are ... not necessary to substantiate material facts or conditions.” 390 S.C. at 623, 703 S.E.2d at 228 (emphasis added).

Because the grand jury does not finally adjudicate guilt or innocence, it has traditionally been allowed to pursue its investigative and accusatorial functions unimpeded by the evidentiary and procedural restrictions applicable to a criminal trial.  Permitting witnesses to invoke the exclusionary rule before a grand jury would precipitate adjudication of issues hitherto reserved for the trial on the merits and would delay and disrupt grand jury proceedings.

Dayton went to Pratt's house and when Martina, Pratt's mother, answered the door, Dayton told Martina he was there to collect a bill owed by Pratt. Martina told Dayton that because of her illness, Pratt had been unemployed for six months, that she was still ill and unable to work, and that she would pay the bill as soon as she could. Dayton, in a loud voice, demanded to see Pratt and said that if he did not receive payment immediately, he would file a criminal complaint charging her with fraud. Pratt, hearing the conversation, came to the door. Dayton, in a loud voice, repeated his demand for immediate payment and his threat to use criminal process.

Wells, 936 S.W.2d 618, 622 (Tenn. 1998) (citing Medlin v. Allied Inv. Co., 217 Tenn. 469, 479, 398 S.W.2d 270, 274 (Tenn. 1966), overruled on other grounds by Camper v. Minor, 915 S.W.2d 437 (Tenn. 1996) ) ). “A plaintiff's burden to demonstrate outrageous conduct ‘is not an easy burden to meet.’ ” Weaver v. Pardue, No. M2010–00124–COA–R3–CV, 2010 WL 4272687, at *5 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 28, 2010) (quoting Oates v. Chattanooga Pub. Co., 205 S.W.3d 418, 428 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2006) ). Outrageous conduct “ ‘does not extend to mere insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppression or other trivialities.’ ” Bain, 936 S.W.2d at 622 (quoting Medlin, 398 S.W.2d at 274). “[I]t is the court's duty in the first instance to apply that standard and determine ‘whether the defendant's conduct may reasonably be regarded as so extreme and outrageous as to permit recovery....’ ” Bain, 936 S.W.2d at 623 (quoting Medlin, 398 S.W.2d at 275). As our supreme court has explained:\n“The cases thus far decided have found liability only where the defendant's conduct has been extreme and outrageous. It has not been enough that the defendant has acted with an intent which is tortious or even criminal, or that he has intended to inflict emotional distress, or even that his conduct has been characterized by ‘malice,’ or a degree of aggravation which would entitle the plaintiff to punitive damages for another tort. Liability has been found only where the conduct has been so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community. Generally, the case is one in which the recitation of the facts to an average member of the community would arouse his resentment against the actor, and lead him to exclaim, ‘Outrageous.’ ”\nBain, 936 S.W.2d at 622–23 (quoting Medlin, 398 S.W.2d at 274 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts § 46 cmt. d (1965) ) ).",
